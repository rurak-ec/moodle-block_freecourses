# Translations (kept out of the shipped plugin)

The Moodle plugins directory policy is that **only the English language pack ships with a plugin**:

> "Just the English strings should ship with the plugin. All other translations are supposed to be
> submitted as contributions at lang.moodle.org once your plugin is approved."
> — <https://moodledev.io/general/community/plugincontribution/checklist>

So the canonical English pack lives in the plugin (`workspace/block_freecourses/lang/en/`), and any
other language is **kept here, outside the plugin**, so it is *not* packaged into the released ZIP.

## What's here
- `es/block_freecourses.php` — Spanish translation, kept in sync with the English keys.

## How to use it

### After the plugin is approved (recommended)
Contribute the Spanish strings to **lang.moodle.org (AMOS)**. Once accepted, Spanish reaches **every**
Spanish Moodle site (including yours) through the normal language-pack update mechanism — no shipping
required. See <https://moodledev.io/general/community/plugincontribution/translatingplugins>.

### On your own site, before approval (optional, not for redistribution)
If you want Spanish on your site right now, either:
- copy `es/block_freecourses.php` back to `blocks/freecourses/lang/es/block_freecourses.php` on
  **your** install (do not commit it into the published plugin), or
- use **Site administration → Language → Language customisation** to override the `block_freecourses`
  strings for `es`.

## Keeping it in sync
When you add/change a key in `workspace/block_freecourses/lang/en/block_freecourses.php`, mirror it
here so the Spanish stays complete for the eventual AMOS submission.
