# Contributing to block_freecourses

Thanks for your interest in improving the **Free courses** block.

## Ground rules
- The plugin is licensed under the **GNU GPL v3 or later**. By contributing you agree your
  contribution is released under the same license.
- Follow the [Moodle coding style](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/codingstyle)
  and the [Moodle development policies](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies).
- Keep all code comments and identifiers in **English**.
- Preserve existing copyright notices; add your own `@copyright` line rather than replacing one.

## Development
- Plugin source lives in [`workspace/block_freecourses`](workspace/block_freecourses).
- After changing `amd/src/*.js`, rebuild the AMD bundle with `grunt amd` (do **not** hand-edit
  `amd/build/*`) so CI's grunt check passes.
- Bump `$plugin->version` in `version.php` for any DB or behavioural change, and update
  [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
